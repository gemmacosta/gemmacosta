- 👋 Hi, I am @gemmacosta, I am a Research Fellow at the Frascati National Laboratories, in the SPARC_LAB group. 
I work on new kinds of plasma-based accelerators, both in beam and laser-driven schemes. Every day I handle a laser beam with a peak power of 250 TeraWatts!
- 🌱 My job is mainly experimental but I love coding, I’m currently learning fluid-dynamic and MHD codes. 
I also enjoy writing data analysis codes, building image processing, e.g. in Matlab, or designing simplified models of complex processes, e.g. using Mathematica.
- 👀 I’m interested in gas and cold plasma physics simulations to give a more accurate direction to my experiments. 
- 💞️ In particular, I am currently using the OpenFOAM code to simulate flow through a small 3D capillary. 
I would like to learn how to apply a high-voltage electrical discharge to this gas flow, and follow the resulting plasma generation. 
I am looking to collaborate on this topic with anyone who might be interested in this type of physics and has experience with these experimental processes and/or this kind of simulations.
